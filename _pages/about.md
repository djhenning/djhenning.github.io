Hi! I am a sixth year PhD student in economics at UCLA, and student affiliate at the California Center for Population Research. My studies are supported by Norges Bank's PhD scholarship program.

My primary fields are development and public economics with a focus on firms.

I received my bachelor in Economics, Politics and International Studies at [Warwick University](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/), and had the privilege to complete my high school at [UWCAd](https://www.uwcad.it/).

**I am on the job market in 2024-2025 and available for interviews.**

In my [**Job Market Paper**](https://djhenning.github.io/assets/pdf/Henning_JMP.pdf) I investigate the distortionary impact of tax audits in Uganda.
