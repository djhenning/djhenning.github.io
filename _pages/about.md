Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Oxford University.

My primary fields are development and public economics with a focus on firms.

I received my PhD in economics at UCLA, my bachelor in Economics, Politics and International Studies at [Warwick University](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/), and had the privilege to complete my high school at [UWCAd](https://www.uwcad.it/).
